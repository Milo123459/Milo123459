Hey, my name is [Milo](https://milo.solar) and I love working on open source projects. Currently, I maintain a few Rust crates such as [chrono](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono), [with_lock](https://github.com/Milo123459/with_lock) and some other work in progress projects.

One of my favourite projects I have ever worked on is [Glitter](https://github.com/Milo123459/glitter) - a commit templating tool for git, along with some useful tricks to make your life easier. Do consider checking out the readme for a more in-depth tutorial, or supporting me by clicking that star button!

If you want to help me make my hobby profitable, do consider [sponsoring me](https://git.io/sponsor-milo)! Anything helps :)

If you want to chat with me, you can join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/q83hQYe5QR) and send me a DM.

Thank you for reading! ðŸ‘‹
